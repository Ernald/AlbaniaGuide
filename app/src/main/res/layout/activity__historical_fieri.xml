                android:text="Fier is a city and a municipality in Fier County in southwest Albania. The population of the municipality at the 2011 census was 120,655, and of the town proper (the municipality before the 2015 local government reforms) 55,845.
\n\nGeographically, it is located in the centre of the country surrounded by hills. The city is located some 16 kilometres east of the Adriatic Sea and 100 kilometres south of Tirana.
\n\nFier is 11 km (7 mi) from the ruins of the ancient city of Apollonia. The city was founded in 588 BCE by Ancient Greek colonists from Corfu and Corinth, on a site initially occupied by Illyrian tribes.
\n\nApollonia  was an Ancient Greek city located on the right bank of the Aous/Vjosë river.[1] Its ruins are geographically situated in the county of Fier, close to the village of Pojani (Polina), in Albania.
\n\nApollonia was founded in 588 BC by Ancient Greek colonists from the island of Corfu and Corinth on a largely abandoned site on the Illyrian coast. It was perhaps the most important of the several classical towns known as Apollonia. It flourished in the Roman period and was home to a renowned school of philosophy, acquiring fame as a cultural center that attracted many brilliant students from different parts of the empire, including Augustus, the first Roman emperor. The city began to decline in the 3rd century AD when its harbor started silting up as a result of an earthquake. It was abandoned by the end of Late Antiquity.
The name of the city is mentioned among the modern bishoprics of the Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania (Apollonia and Fier). Apollonia is also a titular see of the Latin Church. The ruins were designated as an archaeological park on 7 April 2003 by the government of Albania.
